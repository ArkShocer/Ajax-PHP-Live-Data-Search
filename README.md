PHP Live Data Search with a Database

AJAX Live Search is a jQuery plugin / PHP search form that searches and displays the result as you type.

If you wanna use Bootstrap 4 check out the other branch!

### Getting started with Ajax Live Search

1. **Copy** the folders including **bootstrap, js, and theme** to your project.

2. Be sure to **check** the **fetch.php** for your **database and Table** configuration!

You can easily change the css by replacing the **bootstrap.css** to an other Bootstrap css for this I'm using Lumen from *https://bootswatch.com/* for this repository
